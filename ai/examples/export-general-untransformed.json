More details in the link.\n- Google Drive: Let's use Google Drive as a \"raw bucket\" for files and Notion as the main documentation structure in which we link files from Google Drive. The shared drive All contains files that are shared company-wide. The structure is topic-based (see screenshot). We used the same terms as in the Google Chat spaces.

The scope is extended bi-weekly with client updates or product demos, and we cover full weekly priorities on Monday. I believe this saves us time without sacrificing alignment. If these multi-purpose meetings, such as product & client updates and product demos, become too large, we can split them up further down the line. I don't anticipate that happening as long as we stay in a group of 3-5.\n\nHappy to do the changes in the calendar if you like the suggestion (now we can modify all events).",

          "text": "”Why Existing Supplier Matchmaking Platforms Are Limited\n\nMost current platforms:\n\t•\tFocus on static supplier vetting — based on uploaded documents, certifications, or past audits\n\t•\tOffer basic search/filtering (e.g., “show me all FSC-certified wood suppliers in Indonesia”)\n\t•\tRely on self-reported or manually maintained data\n\t•\tAre compliance-driven: “Is this supplier okay?” rather than “Is this supplier optimal under evolving constraints?”\n\nThey’re directories with forms and filters, not intelligent systems. They don’t reason, simulate, or match dynamically based on context.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy Your Platform Disrupts\n\n1. You Match Based on Simulated Business Outcomes, Not Just Checklists\n\t•\tYour agents simulate the real-world impact of a deal before suggesting a match: pricing stability, nature impact, regulation exposure, supply resilience.\n\t•\tThis isn’t just “find me a certified supplier” — it’s “find me the one that maximizes ROI across price, risk, impact, and compliance under this scenario.”\n\nThink: not filtering for traits — but optimizing for outcomes.\n\n⸻\n\n2. You’re Constraint- and Strategy-Aware\n\nTraditional platforms don’t understand your company’s:\n\t•\tProcurement goals\n\t•\tNature or climate commitments\n\t•\tRisk tolerance\n\t•\tRegulatory exposure\n\t•\tProduct compositions\n\nYour agents do. They reason across internal business logic, external data, and multi-objective constraints. This means:\n\t•\tA food company with EU market exposure and SBTN targets gets a very different match than an industrial OEM in the US.\n\t•\tYou provide company-specific, context-aware, just-in-time matches.\n\n⸻\n\n3.

Cuts Time-to-Deal from Months to Hours*\n\t•\tTraditional sourcing and onboarding takes weeks/months\n\t•\tYour system could surface and prep viable matches in *minutes*\n\t•\tThe buyer doesn’t search — the agent finds and pitches optimized deals\n\n*2. Creates a New Marketplace Logic*\n\t•\tInstead of a fixed supplier directory, you’re creating *self-representing agents* that surface when relevant\n\t•\tYou create a live, intelligent *ecosystem of trading agents*\n\n*3. Builds Unmatched Data Moat*\n\t•\tEvery simulation, match, and deal improves your system’s reasoning\n\t•\tYou create unique deal-level intelligence: what worked, what didn’t, under what conditions\n\t•\tYou infer real performance, not just certification\n\n*4. Platform Stickiness and Switching Cost Explodes*\n\t•\tOnce clients build procurement workflows on this system, *you become embedded infrastructure*\n\t•\tThe value compounds over time — no competitor can replicate the emergent intelligence or agent-to-agent interactions\n\n⸻\n\n*Positioning Narrative*\n\n“We’re building the first autonomous global sourcing network — where every product, supplier, and buyer is represented by intelligent agents that continuously negotiate the best deals under real-world constraints. Humans step in only to finalize — everything else is reasoned, simulated, and prepared by AI.”"

It should take 2-3 days to integrate the data into our app.\n❓However, the data does not contain the scope as filter criteria yet. I'll ask FPL if they can provide a new data extract with the scope included.\n\nClarification\n❓@Alan Häkkä In the midpoint impact results mapping spreadsheet, you categorized nox_total_EDGAR_consistent, nh3_total_EDGAR_consistent, and so2_total_EDGAR_consistent pollution. In FPL dataset and in initial spec'ed categories, it is categorized as climate emissions. What is correct and in particular to which of our group in our material view should these impact categories?\n❓@Alan Häkkä How do you want to align on how to map, calculate and display the newly provided impact categories in the app?\n\nAdditional impact groups and categories\n💡❓The raw dataset includes additional impact groups and categories for energy, biodiversity_loss, employment, employment_skill, and various materials. You can see that best by unzipping fpl_meta.zip and opening the GLORIA_satellites.csv. @Alan Häkkä @Henrik Suikkanen Do we want to calculate/display any of these impact groups and categories?",

Broadly speaking, it looks like you've delivered as agreed, and we really appreciate the flat scope adjustment as mentioned earlier. The additional details on data quality are also very helpful—this will certainly support us in providing transparency to our clients regarding potential discrepancies.\n\nCommercial Terms\nIt’s great that we don’t need to amend existing contracts and can proceed under the pilot agreement through to the end of September. Please feel free to send the invoice for AUD 2,500—we’ll process the payment as aligned. No need for a formal quote, as long as the invoice includes the required amounts and other key payment details.\n\nStrategic Partnership\nWe’re very happy to see that we’re aligned in our thinking. We agree that broader earth systems data will grow in demand over the coming years, and having a robust, trustworthy non-GHG intensity dataset will be a real competitive advantage. We're excited about the potential of this partnership—our goal is to provide you with fast, actionable feedback that supports ongoing data quality assurance.\n\nHere are some thoughts on the collaboration examples you suggested:\n“Built with / Powered by FootprintLab” note → This sounds great. We’ll come back with concrete ideas for this closer to our public launch in the fall.\nShare validation results → Absolutely. We'll continue with the structured validation process already in place and flag any key findings as we test the data.\nUse cases for publication → Also a good idea. We’re planning a few case studies during our launch, and I’m confident one will highlight FPL data effectively—e.g., pinpointing impact hotspots across supply chain tiers.\nJoint media moment → Definitely something to consider longer-term. As our product matures and we gather strong client feedback, this could be a great way to boost visibility together.\nTestimonial or success story → Yes, we’re open to this. Let’s revisit once we wrap up our first pilots and have a clearer picture of the outcomes.\n\nAdditional Thoughts\nWe’d also love to support the expansion of your intensity factor data offering. For instance, we’d be keen to explore whether there’s a way to help you secure commercial rights to EXIOBASE, if that’s a possibility. Ideally, we’d like the EEMRIO data to come in a standardized and harmonized format—and it feels like we’re moving in that direction with you.\n\nTo help drive this forward, happy to set a reminder for August to begin following up on these points, once we’re clearer on the timing of our public launch.\n\nFinally, we truly appreciate your willingness to give us time to demonstrate commercial viability before formalizing a subscription. \n\nIn return, we’re committed to going the extra mile in helping you battle-test your data and ensure the success of your non-GHG dataset offering.\n\nKind regards,\nAlan",
